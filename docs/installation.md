# Installation

Installation using Docker is currently the only supported way. Support for rootless Podman is planned.

Take the `docker-compose.prod.yaml` compose file as a starting point

See [settings.md](settings.md) for a list of environment variables.

After installation, the `manage` command should be used to add users. See [manage.md](./manage.md) for more information.
